This is going to be the repo that I keep all of the tutorials that I do while working with the ScrollMagic and GreenSock API.

I plan to use this as a base to create a performance first portfolio site.

This will display my apptitude for design, animation, and development.

Still working through these animation tutorials

Possibly moving back to Angular 2.0 after I finish these
